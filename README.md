# Binance Enhancement Suite, Version 0.1 (Beta)

Note: This extension is NOT affiliated with Binance.

The Binance Enhancement Suite is a Chrome extension that adds various UI enhancements to the Binance trading exchange.  
There aren't many features just yet (currently just minor quality-of-life changes), as I wanted to quickly push out an MVP in order to gauge interest and (hopefully) gather feature requests.
To request new features, leave feedback, or report a bug, please submit an issue to the repo or shoot me an email at wherearethefaces@gmail.com.

#### Current Features:
- Sort coins in portfolio by value
- Optionally display coin balances as USD
- Customize minimum coin balance to display
